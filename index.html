    <h1>Stud of the Spuds: Become the Spudliest!</h1>

    <p>
      Take the role of a valiant warrior battling to become the spudliest stud the reknowned Potato Arena has ever seen! Armed with only your trusty Spud Cannon, battle an onslaught of tubers to obtain your well-deserved title.
    </p>

    <h2>Weapons:</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spud Cannon - Gun</li>
        <li>Gnaids (Gnocchi) - Grenades</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>
      Kill enemies with your mighty Spud Cannon to earn points. Be careful, your enemies are also armed with potato guns (although they clearly aren't as cool as yours). Earn bonus points by knocking their weak-tubers clean out of the air! Once a potato hits an object (yes, any object) it becomes cold. You'll need to hit your targets with hot potatoes to score points. At the end of all five waves, you'll be rewarded a title based on the number of points you earned. Rack up enough points to become the Stud of the Spuds and take your seat on the revered Starchy Throne!
