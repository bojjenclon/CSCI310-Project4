          <h3>Become the Spudliest!</h3>

          <p>
            Take the role of a valiant warrior battling to become the spudliest stud the reknowned Potato Arena has ever seen! Armed with only your trusty Spud Cannon, battle an onslaught of tubers to obtain your well-deserved title.

              Kill enemies with your mighty Spud Cannon to earn points. Be careful, your enemies are also armed with potato guns (although they clearly aren't as cool as yours). Earn bonus points by knocking their weak-tubers clean out of the air! Once one of your potato-based munitions hits an object (yes, any object) it becomes cold. Your ammo will need to be hot upon reaching its target to apply its damage (and score those much needed points!). At the end of all five waves, you'll be rewarded a title based on the number of points you've earned. Rack up enough points to become the Stud of the Spuds and take your seat on the revered Starchy Throne!

                    The Totally Awesome Tuber Expelling Rifle shoots out a single potato that deals a large amount of damage to the first foe hit. Good for trying to take down one target at a time.

                    A modification to the T.A.T.E.R allows it to dice its tubers on their way out. The Scatter Fries mod shoots out a random number of french fries in a spread-shot. Fries deal reduced damage, but have a higher chance of hitting multiple targets or blocking incoming projectiles. Good for fighting off swarms of enemies.
